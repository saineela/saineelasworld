My Personal Website, Designed for *MOONSHOT* - Made with HackClub Spaces!

## Day 1 - 10/17/2025:
I started working on my Moonshot project to design a personal website from scratch (I never had 1 before). I am new to Javascript, but for HTML and CSS I am alright and this would be a great learning oppertunity for me!.

**Description**: Created HTML, CSS and Javascript files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) and also a vercel.json for binding page urls directly, for example ("/blog" instead of "/blog.html") to look neat 😋. Just Created a navigation bar with cool neumorphistic transition, hovering with javascript was crazy though (went through Mozzila docs for onmouseover and its events). CSS - Complicated to find the exact shadows and requirements to look neat and similar to my imagination, so I asked ChatGPT for support with CSS parameters and errors. Javascript - It was TORTURE, had to look at other open source projects for help (I'm a noobie IK).

**NOTE**: I Started this project on Oct 17th though this repository was created on Oct 18, I did'nt read the Moonshot FAQ rules for Journaling Guide, Having Already completed my commits with random info and same msg saying "Update from Hack Club Spaces". I didnt know how to rename exisitng commits, so I deleted that repository and created a new one. The commits didnt have an image placement option so I created a Journaling Guide in README.md file.
